      Naruto (ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
      Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who
      seeks to gain recognition from his peers and also dreams of becoming the
      Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts, the first
      set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is
      based on two one-shot manga by <em>Karakuri (1995)</em>, which earned
      <i>Kishimoto</i> an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
      the following year, and Naruto (1997).
